"""The ``SchedulerEngine`` — a thin registrar over a host-owned scheduler (D-15).

The host constructs, ``start()``s, and ``shutdown()``s its own background
scheduler; this engine is a NON-owning facade that holds a reference to it and
exposes exactly three operations the host's registration loop needs:
``register`` (add a job), ``remove`` (drop one by id), and ``list_live_ids``
(read the currently-scheduled ids). It deliberately owns NO lifecycle — there is
no ``start``/``shutdown`` on this class (D-15 / A4).

Its one job is to bake the three job-options that every host call site repeated
by hand into a SINGLE place so they can no longer drift apart (D-03):
``misfire_grace_time=None`` (cross-restart recovery is owned by a durable
sent-log + catch-up scan, NOT the scheduler), ``coalesce=True`` (collapse a
backlog of missed fires into one), and ``max_instances=1`` (never overlap two
runs of the same job). ``max_instances=1`` happens to be APScheduler's own
``add_job`` default, so baking it in is behavior-preserving for the call sites
that omit it — a fact pinned by a job-options read-back test, not a string golden.

The native trigger object passes THROUGH untouched (D-01): the engine never
constructs or inspects a trigger, so the host keeps full control of cron/interval
semantics and the schedule golden stays byte-identical. The callback and its
``args``/``kwargs`` are likewise opaque — the engine never names or reads them,
so any host (a different bot) binds its own callable through the identical hole
(D-05). No ``cron()``/``interval()``/``date()`` trigger-sugar methods (D-02).
