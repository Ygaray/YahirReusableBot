"""``PanelKit`` — the generic persistent operator-panel view machinery (SEAM-07, D-03/D-04).

The reusable-module home of the app's persistent panel view. ``PanelKit`` owns the
generic, domain-agnostic mechanics:

- the persistent-view contract (``timeout=None``, all-static-``custom_id`` children,
  the build-time child-cap asserts, the single clone path),
- the **registry-derived command buttons** built FROM the Phase-26 ``CommandRegistry``
  (one :class:`CmdButton` per curated ``command_names`` entry),
- the **operator gate** (``interaction_check`` — bot reject with no ephemeral, non-operator
  reject with an identity-free ephemeral + the sole audit log),
- the per-callback **non-propagating failure-isolation envelope** + the ``View.on_error``
  backstop + ``_safe_error_edit`` (never re-raises),
- the ownership predicate (author + an **app-supplied marker**, D-04).

Everything app-specific is INJECTED at construction (the module's locked
constructor-injection-of-opaque-callables idiom — ``CommandRegistry(specs)`` /
``SchedulerEngine(scheduler)`` / ``ReloadEngine(validate=…)``):

- ``marker`` (D-04 — REQUIRED, no default; the module bakes no marker literal of its own),
- ``render`` (D-01 — the opaque app embed builder the module invokes but never inspects),
- ``contributors`` (D-03 — the app's item builders for its own cosmetic components; each
  is a clone factory the module re-invokes on every render),
- ``dispatch`` (the app closure that runs the per-tap fetch/dispatch off-loop and returns
  a generic :class:`DispatchOutcome`),
- ``selection`` (D-02 — the generic :class:`SelectedContext` holder),
- ``operator_id`` (D-06 — baked at construction; the v1 deferral is preserved).

THE LIVE-ROUTING TRAP (the highest-risk mechanism — clone-dead-after-first-tap): discord.py
routes component interactions by ``message_id`` FIRST, and ``edit_message(view=clone)`` binds
the clone to the panel message — so every tap AFTER the first render dispatches to the
clone's children, NOT the persistent ``add_view``-registered ``self``. A clone carrying a
plain ``discord.ui.Button``/``Select`` (whose base ``callback`` is a no-op ``pass`` in
discord.py 2.7.1) therefore goes DEAD after the first tap with no log. The cure: the clone
path rebuilds every child as a REAL callback-bearing item bound to ``self`` — the module
rebuilds its own :class:`CmdButton`s and RE-INVOKES each app contributor (never an
``isinstance`` check on an app component class). ``disabled`` is applied post-construction
(the item ctors take no ``disabled`` param).

    - ``error_message`` — when set (NOT ``None``), the app signalled a known, user-presentable

      and NO embed, exactly mirroring the v1 in-place error edit. ``reply`` is ignored.
